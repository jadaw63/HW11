### Summary of Results
Within the Risk Ensemble analysis, the Balanced Random Forest Classfier and the Easy Ensemble Classifier had the worst accuracy scores between models of 0.004533565823888404. 

For the models executed within the Risk Resampling analysis, SMOTE Undersampling and Undersampling have the same accuracy score of 0.6621602612787003, they are the best in comparison.

Overall, the best recall score was 1.0 using the Naive Random Oversampling method, the highest geometric mean score was 0.66 from the SMOTE Oversampling method. The top three features from the Balanced Random Forest Classfier were loan_status_low_risk = 0.3695, loan_status_high_risk = 0.2971, and total_rec_int = 0.0343.
